### About the project
A project that studies the total stopping distance of a car under multiple circumstances and variables. In the first part of the project there is a break down of the problem into multiple parts, followed by a mathematical analysis.

The second part and [**main program.pdf**](Principal.m) requests user input and calculates the total stopping distance of a car.
