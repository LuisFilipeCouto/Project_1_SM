# Project_1_SM

### About the project
A study about the total stopping distance (perception-reaction distance + braking distance) of a car under multiple circumstances and variables such as:
<ul>
<li>Pavement Material (Dirt, Concrete, Asphalt)</li>
<li>Pavement Condition (Dry, Wet, Ice, Snow)</li>
<li>Driver Age</li>
</ul>

In the first part of the project there is a break down of the problem into multiple sections, followed by a mathematical analysis of each one.<br>
The second part is a simulation of the problem, consisting of multiple MATLAB scripts that together constitute the [**main program**](Principal.m), which requests user input and calculates the total stopping distance, while also plotting multiples graphs that allow to draw conclusions.
